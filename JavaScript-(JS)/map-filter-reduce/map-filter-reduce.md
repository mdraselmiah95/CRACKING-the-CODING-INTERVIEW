### ( `map`, `filter` and `reduce` ) - Polyfills and Output Based Questions?

#### Answer

#### Map

`Map` returns a new array that contains an image of each element of the array. It will always return the same number of items.

```js
const myAwesomeArray = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1];

myAwesomeArray.map((x) => x * x);

// >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Output: [25, 16, 9, 4, 1]
```
